- Multi-screen application architecture

---

### **Experiment 5: State Management**
**Objective**: Learn stateful/stateless widgets, setState, and Provider pattern

**State Management Techniques:**
- ✅ **StatelessWidget**: Immutable widget examples
- ✅ **StatefulWidget**: Local state with setState()
- ✅ **Provider Pattern**: Global state management
- ✅ **Form State**: Form validation and data handling
- ✅ **Consumer Widgets**: Reactive UI updates

**Interactive Examples:**
- Local counter with setState()
- Global counter with Provider
- Color selector with dropdown
- Form validation with TextFormField
- Cross-widget state sharing

**Key Learning Outcomes:**
- State management patterns
- Widget lifecycle understanding
- Provider pattern implementation
- Form handling best practices
